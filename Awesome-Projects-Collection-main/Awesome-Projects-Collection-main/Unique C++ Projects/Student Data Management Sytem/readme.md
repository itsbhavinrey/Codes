Our code is a basic implementation of a Student Management Project written in C++  using file handling. 
• C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language
• File handling is used to store a data permanently in computer. The data can be stored in secondary memory (hard disk) using file handling.


The data stored using this code are:
