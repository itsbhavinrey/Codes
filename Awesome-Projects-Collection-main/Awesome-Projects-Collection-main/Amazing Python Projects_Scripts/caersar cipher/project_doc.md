# Project name - Caesar Cipher
### This project is made using Python Language

Tool to decrypt/encrypt with Caesar. Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a shift cipher, one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems. It uses the substitution of a letter by another one further in the alphabet.



It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
