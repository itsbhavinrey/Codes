- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): A simple web server utility for Visual Studio Code

## Setup

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/ron2111/Awesome-Projects-Collection/archive/master.zip), or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:
